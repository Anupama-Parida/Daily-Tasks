In this task, i have built a Spring Boot application that demonstrates Kafkaâ€™s producer-consumer flow.
Orders sent to the /orders endpoint are published to a Kafka topic,
and a consumer listens to the topic to process and print the orders.
This provides basic understanding of how microservices communicate asynchronously using Kafka.
