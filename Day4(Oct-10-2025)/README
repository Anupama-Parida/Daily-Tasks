This is a simple microservices task demonstrating synchronous communication between two services,
EmployeeService and EmpOrderService, using REST APIs. EmployeeService fetches order details from EmpOrderService
via RestTemplate and returns a combined response.
In this task i have used Swagger instead of postman,for testing the endpoints.
